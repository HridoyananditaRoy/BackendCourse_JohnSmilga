//Middleware
//It is the heart and soul of Express.js.
//It is a function that has access to the request object (req), 
// the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle.

//It can perform the following tasks:
//- Execute any code.
//- Make changes to the request and response objects.
//- End the request-response cycle.
//- Call the next middleware function in the stack.
//- If the current middleware function does not end the request-response cycle,
//  it must call next() to pass control to the next middleware function.
