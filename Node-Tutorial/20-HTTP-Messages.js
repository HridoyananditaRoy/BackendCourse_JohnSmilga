//How we rexchange data between the browser and server
//We use HTTP protocol to exchange data between the browser and server
//Example: when we make a request to a server, the server responds with data
//We can use the http module in nodejs to create a server and listen for requests
//We can also use the http module to make requests to other servers
//We can use the http module to create a server and listen for requests

//We exchange data on the web using HTTP protocol

//For Youtube, we use HTTP protocol to exchange data between the browser and server

//We use 'Get' method to get data from the server

//http messages-
//the client sends http reqquest message to the server

//Why we need to make web servers using nodejs?
//----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//We need to make web servers using nodejs 
// because it is a JavaScript runtime that allows us to run JavaScript on the server side
//Node.js is built on the V8 JavaScript engine, which is used in Google Chrome
//This allows us to use JavaScript to create web servers and handle requests
//Node.js is an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient
//It is designed to build scalable network applications

//Http messages
//Express is a web framework for Node.js that simplifies the process of building web applications and APIs.
//It provides a set of features and tools to handle HTTP requests, routing, middleware, and

//Web Servers are computers that store and serve web content.
//They respond to HTTP requests from clients (browsers) and send back the requested content
//Web Servers are used to host websites and web applications.
//Real life example of a web server is Apache or Nginx.
//They are stored on a computer that is connected to the internet.
//Web Servers are used to host websites and web applications.

//It dont have GUI, it is a command line tool.

//we can access our files from anywhere in the world as long as we have an internet connection

//Get is the default method used to retrieve data from a server
//Headers are used to send additional information with the request

//Response msg we will get from the server
